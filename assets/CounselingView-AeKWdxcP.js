With a 95% success rate, we are pleased to say that lives can be changed and renewed through a personal relationship with Jesus, transforming worry and problems into relief and happiness. This program is open to everyone. </p><p>Exchanged Life Counseling was initiated years ago by Charles Solomon and has since grown into a worldwide ministry.

They can assist with bill consolidation, negotiating reductions on outstanding debts, and setting you on the path to financial freedom. </li><li><b>Substance Abuse</b>: This problem affects 70% of families today. Children are often put on drugs to &quot;control their behavior,&quot; and stress is managed with prescriptions that can cause loss of control over one&#39;s mind and body, leading to many other issues. One pill often leads to another, creating a cycle. Our staff has successfully helped many people overcome alcohol and street drug addictions that take the lives of loved ones. We also offer group counseling, where participants can relate to and encourage each other.</li><li><b>Family Relationship Problems</b>: Parents and children, as well as spouses, often struggle to relate to and understand each other. We offer guidance on pregnancy and how to handle unplanned births. </li><li><b>Suicide</b>: All of the above issues can lead to thoughts of suicide. Don&#39;t let Satan winâ€”address these issues as soon as possible.</li><li><b>Health Problems</b>: Our healthcare system has lost its place as the best in the world. We can help you navigate your medical needs, understand insurance, and manage medical bills. </li><li><b>Understanding Yourself</b>: Come and discover who you are and what your purpose in life is. </li></ul></div>',3),O=[P];function F(s,t,i,V,Y,a){const c=r("motion-fade-visible-once"),d=r("motion");return n(),o(u,null,[l((n(),o("div",b,[e("div",w,[_,e("div",x,[e("div",y,[L,e("div",S,[e("button",{onClick:t[0]||(t[0]=(...h)=>a.scrollToSection&&a.scrollToSection(...h)),class:"btn btn-primary"},C)]),E])])]),k])),[[c]]),l((n(),o("div",B,O)),[[d]])],64)}const j=f(v,[["render",F]]);export{j as default};
