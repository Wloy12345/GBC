One God who eternally manifested in three distinct persons, The Father, The Son, and the Holy Spirit; who are equal in Glory and Majesty and exist in perfect unity. In each of these divine persons is the fullness of the living God. We believe that God is Eternal, that He exists across all of time and that there was never a time when he did not exist. We believe that all Goodness in creation comes from Him. </p></div></div><div id="salvationSec" class="grid grid-cols-1 md:grid-cols-2"><div class="p-5 col-start-2"><div class="flex justify-center"><h1 class="text-5xl font-bold text-primary">Salvation</h1></div><p class="indent-8"> We affirm, with the testimony of the Saints that have gone before us, that Salvation is found only in the name of Jesus Christ, Iésous Christos in Greek, and Yeshua Hamashiach in Hebrew. We affirm that He lived a sinless life, suffered under Pontious Pilate, was crucified, suffered a sinner’s death, was buried, and rose again on the third day. We affirm that His death was an atoning sacrifice, the only true sacrifice in all of history. We affirm that anyone who believes in and calls on the name of the Lord, Jesus, and makes Him Lord of their life is saved from death, hell, and the grave. And all that those things mean. </p></div></div><div id="holySpiritSec" class="grid grid-cols-1 md:grid-cols-2"><div class="p-5"><div class="flex justify-center"><h1 class="text-5xl font-bold text-primary">Holy Spirit</h1></div><p class="indent-8"> We believe that the Holy Spirit, through whom all things were made, indwells the believer at the moment of salvation, and begins to change and reform both the internal and external life of that believer. We believe that the Holy Sprit guides his Church and molds it into what He wants it to be. We believe that the Holy Spirit gives gifts to the Body of Christ for the benefit of the Body. </p></div></div><div id="conceptionSec" class="grid grid-cols-1 md:grid-cols-2"><div class="p-5 col-start-2"><div class="flex justify-center"><h1 class="text-5xl font-bold text-primary"> Immaculate Conception</h1></div><p class="indent-8"> We believe that Marry the mother of Jesus, in her obedience to God the Father, was overshadowed by the Holy Spirit and conceived Jesus as a virgin woman. </p></div></div><div id="spiritWorldSec" class="grid grid-cols-1 md:grid-cols-2"><div class="p-5"><div class="flex justify-center"><h1 class="text-5xl font-bold text-primary"> Spiritual world</h1></div><p class="indent-8"> We believe is a spiritual world that is separate from and typically invisible to the physical world.

Believers should spend their lives with other believers, desiring the best for one another, believing and hoping the best for one another in love. </p></div></div><div id="marriageSec" class="grid grid-cols-1 md:grid-cols-2"><div class="p-5 col-start-2"><div class="flex justify-center"><h1 class="text-5xl font-bold text-primary"> Marriage and Family</h1></div><p class="indent-8"> We believe that God ordained marriage is between one man and one woman.

We believe that it is the norm and foundation for all Christian doctrine, life, and teaching. We believe that Scripture, through the working of the Holy Spirit, is able to produce change in the life of a believer in a Christward direction.
